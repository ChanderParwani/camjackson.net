            <h2>Micro frontends</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>Speaking & Writing</h3>
              <p>
                Micro frontends is an architectural style where independently deliverable
                frontend applications are composed into a greater whole. I helped pioneer
                the technique, and have written and spoken extensively on the topic. You
                can find some of my writing on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html">martinfowler.com</a>,
                and <a href="https://microfrontends.com/">microfrontends.com</a>.

            <div>
              <h3>Implementation</h3>
              <p>
                I've worked with multiple household names to transform their frontend
                architectures, increasing team autonomy, and drastically improving speed
                of delivery, while maintaining product and technical consistency
                where it matters.

              <h3>Practices</h3>
              <p>
                I'm an advocate for XP practices like pair programming and test-driven
                development. Whether I'm working at a start-up or a large enterprise, I
                always encourage my team to improve speed and quality of delivery by
                embracing agile, DevOps, continuous integration and continuous delivery.

              <h3>People skills</h3>
              <p>
                I'm an experienced consultant, with skills in stakeholder management,
                facilitation, teaching, and training. As a team leader, I care deeply
                about the welfare of my team, and I try to make everyone's voice be
                heard, especially those from underrepresented or marginalised groups.

        <h2>My writing</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019 I published a long-form article on micro frontends <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html">on martinfowler.com</a>,
          explaining the theory and practice of this architectural style, including
          a fully-functional demo website. The demo is located at <a href="https://demo.microfrontends.com">demo.microfrontends.com</a>,
          and the source code is all <a href="https://github.com/micro-frontends-demo">on GitHub</a>.

          I haven't blogged in a long time, but my previous articles can be found
          archived <a href="/archive">here</a>.
