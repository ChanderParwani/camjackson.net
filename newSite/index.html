              <h3>Frontend development</h3>
              <p>
                I'm an expert in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've been using React.js
                for almost 5 years. I love working closely with designers to build the best
                user experience possible. My own design skills are rudimentary, but I'm working on it!

              <h3>Backend development</h3>
              <p>
                While frontend is my passion, I believe strongly in full-stack development.
                I have experience building APIs and CLI tools using Node.js, Ruby, Python,
                Rust, and Java. For some strange reason I really enjoy shell scripting too.

              <h3>Ops & Infra</h3>
              <p>
                Whenever possible I own my apps in production, including the path to get there.
                I'm experienced in building CI & CD pipelines, deploying to both cloud and
                on-prem infrastructure, writing all config as code.

            <h2>Micro frontends</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>Speaking & Writing</h3>
              <p>
                Micro frontends is an architectural style where independently deliverable
                frontend applications are composed into a greater whole. I helped pioneer
                the technique, and have written and spoken extensively on the topic. You
                can find some of my writing on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html">martinfowler.com</a>,
                and <a href="https://microfrontends.com/">microfrontends.com</a>.

            <div>
              <h3>Implementation</h3>
              <p>
                I've worked with multiple household-name organisations to transform their frontend
                architectures, increasing team autonomy and drastically improving speed
                of delivery. All while maintaining product and technical consistency
                where it matters.

              <h3>Practices</h3>
              <p>
                I'm an advocate for XP practices like pair programming and test-driven
                development. Whether I'm working at a start-up or a large enterprise, I
                always encourage my team to improve speed and quality of delivery by
                embracing agile, DevOps, continuous integration and continuous delivery.

              <h3>People skills</h3>
              <p>
                I'm an experienced consultant, with skills in stakeholder management,
                influencing, facilitation, and training. As a team lead, I care deeply
                about the welfare of my team, and I try to make everyone's voice be
                heard, especially those from underrepresented or marginalised groups.

        <h2>My writing</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019 I published a long-form article on micro frontends <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html">on martinfowler.com</a>,
          explaining the theory and practice of this architectural style, including
          a fully-functional demo website. The demo is located at <a href="https://demo.microfrontends.com">demo.microfrontends.com</a>,
          and the source code is all <a href="https://github.com/micro-frontends-demo">on GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven't blogged in a long time, but in the past I've written about React.js, Rust, and a few other little things.
          My previous articles can be found archived <a href="/archive">here</a>.
